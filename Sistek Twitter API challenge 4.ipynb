I want to know who else is involved in microtargeting (companies/government entities). I‚Äôd like to gather tweets with the keywords ‚Äúmicrotargeting‚Äù and the ‚Äúinfluence industry‚Äù and use entity extraction to find the entities mentioned in conjunction with these two concepts. I would then like to use topic modeling to identify the most common words/entities out of those found. Then I‚Äôd like to visualize these with a simple histogram."
